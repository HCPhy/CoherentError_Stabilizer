This is the code for stabilizer simulation on the quantum coherent error phase transitions.

This simulation code contains three aspects of stabilizer simulations.
1. The change of logical stabilizers.
2. The change of coherent quantum informations.
3. The change of syndrome distribution conditional mutual information
4. The change of quantum conditional mutual informations.


The sampling algorithm is shown in the Appendix of the paper. 
A central performace optimization is the bitpack method of stabilizer tableaus. See the CMEX function in each folder.
